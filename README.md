Kata Code Sample for P3+Uplift

# A quick (and very dirty) TypeScript code Exercise 
Due to time constraints (very much WIP in many aspects).

# Instructions
This mini-app uses Node and the Node Package Manager for set up, configuration, building,
and running. This is a TypeScript-based application, and doesn't rely on anything else, 
aside from old-fashioned DOM manipulation, localStorage for data, and ostensibly Jest, for
unit testing (ran out of time on the implementation).

Once you've cloned the repository and initialized the application, these commands will get you 
compiling and running:

- To build, type 'npm run build'
- To fire up the web server (lite-server) and work with the app in-browser, type 'npm start'

# Tradeoffs
I made a lot of them on this first pass, as I probably blew too much time on the rather plain-jane UI,
rather than concentrating on a better separation of concerns. As such, it's a crude beast, and lacks a lot of refinement.
But, it works.

# Things I'd do with more time
In a word, plenty.
- Get Jest properly running proper unit tests, instead of ad-hoc iterating on stuff.
- Next time, I'd go with React, because I'm a little rusty at basic DOM. 
    That and having a proper single source of truth would be a big bonus.
- A lot more attention to commenting and clarity.
- Linting!
- Accessibilty (because I'm into that)
- Work out the jankiness and bugs
- Just use Bootstrap, etc., for style.
- 90 minutes from sight-unseen to all of this, however, is pretty significant.
- I probably didn't need to throw together a UI for this, much less with all the form stuff,
    but I though console.log() was just a little underwhelming.
